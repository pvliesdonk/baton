# Project Views (Downstream Guidance)

Use these as recipes in your GitHub Project (table view).

## Planning
- **Group by:** Status
- **Sort by:** Priority (desc)
- **Visible fields:** Title, Priority, Size, Target, Owner, **Context**
- **Filters:** none (or exclude "closed")
- **Why:** quick prioritization and grooming.

## Delivery
- **Filter:** Status ∈ {in‑progress, needs‑review}
- **Group by:** Assignee or Status
- **Sort by:** Priority (desc)
- **Visible fields:** Title, Priority, Target, Owner, Lane
- **Why:** keep the active queue tight and visible.

> Keep the board as the control plane. Do not mirror status in docs.
