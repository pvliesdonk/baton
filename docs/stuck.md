# Stuck Protocol (Baton)

When work stalls, follow this quick ladder. Keep the **board** as the control plane.

1. **State the block clearly.** One sentence + link to evidence.
2. **Ask a better question.** What decision, input, or fact is missing?
3. **Right‑size the scope.** Propose a split (one ticket ≈ one run).
4. **Escalate the lane.** If any Auto‑C trigger applies (public API, schema, auth, new runtime dep, cross‑module coupling, breaking change, major capability), switch to **Lane C**.
5. **Timebox a spike (≤ 0.5 day).** Capture questions + findings on the ticket.
6. **Call the Architect.** SLA: same business day (Europe/Amsterdam).
7. **Decide, record, move.** Add a one‑paragraph note to `DECISIONS.md`, link the Issue/PR.

These rules are **for downstream projects**. Upstream (this repo) documents them; downstream enforces them.
