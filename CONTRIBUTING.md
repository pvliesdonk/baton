# Contributing to Baton

This is the **upstream toolkit**. Keep changes small and well‑scoped.

- Use Issues/PRs; squash merge.
- Docs and templates should be short, copy‑pastable, and pinned (actions by SHA).
- When you add a rule for projects, put it under `templates/` (or docs), not as enforcement here.
- Record notable behavior changes in `DECISIONS.md`.
