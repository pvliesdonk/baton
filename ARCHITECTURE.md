# Architecture (Baton v0.1)

Purpose: the 10k‑ft view. Keep status off this page; the board is the control plane.

## Context & constraints
- Problem statement: _fill per project_.
- Target environment(s): _fill_.
- Key constraints: _fill_.

## System outline
- Major components/modules
- External dependencies
- Critical flows (1–2 diagrams suggested)

## Compatibility policy (optional)
Define what counts as **breaking** here (public API, stable vs experimental, migration paths).

Examples:
- Changing request/response shapes, required flags, or defaults.
- Schema migrations that cannot be applied alongside the old code.
- Altering auth flows or required scopes.

## Observability & operations (brief)
- Logging/metrics/tracing basics.
- Runbook pointers if needed.
