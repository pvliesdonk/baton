# Baton — Agentic Pair‑Engineering Toolkit (v0.1)

Baton is a small, reusable way to pair‑program with AI using **one control plane** (GitHub Issues/Project), three hats (Planner, Architect, Developer), **lanes** (A/B/C), and **context‑fit tickets** (small/medium/large).

**Key ideas**
- One source of truth: the board.
- One profile: Planner/Architect/Developer.
- Lanes: A (routine), B (notify‑then‑go), C (design‑required).
- Tickets sized to fit one conversational run.
- Golden paths: feature flag, CLI command, REST endpoint.

This repo is the upstream kit; projects copy or pin it and add specifics.
